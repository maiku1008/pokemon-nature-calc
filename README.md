# Pokemon Nature Calculator


This small script is to be used with the virtual console versions of Pokemon Red, Blue, Green, Yellow for 3ds, to help determine which natures the pokemon in the GEN1 games will have, when transferred into GEN7 games like Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.

Only obvious requirement to run this script is Python 2.7, native on Linux distros and OSX, and installable on Windows as described on https://docs.python.org/2.7/using/windows.html 

It's sufficient to run python naturecalc.py

Be nice as this is my first python script.
Enjoy!
