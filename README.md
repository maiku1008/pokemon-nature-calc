# Pokemon Nature Calculator


This small script is to be used with the virtual console versions of Pokemon Red, Blue, Green, Yellow for 3ds, to help determine which natures the pokemon in the GEN1 games will have, when transferred into GEN7 games like Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon.

It is sufficient to run

```
python naturecalc.py
```

or for Python 3:
```
python3 naturecalc.py
```
